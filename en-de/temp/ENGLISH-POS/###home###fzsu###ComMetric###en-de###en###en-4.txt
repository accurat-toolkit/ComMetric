Wind/NN power/NN has/VBZ been/VBN used/VBN as/RB long/RB as/IN humans/NNS have/VBP put/VBN sails/NNS into/IN the/DT wind/NN ./. For/IN more/JJR than/IN two/CD millennia/NNS wind-powered/JJ machines/NNS have/VBP ground/NN grain/NN and/CC pumped/VBD water/NN ./. Wind/NN power/NN was/VBD widely/RB available/JJ and/CC not/RB confined/VBN to/TO the/DT banks/NNS of/IN fast-flowing/JJ streams/NNS ,/, or/CC later/RB ,/, requiring/VBG sources/NNS of/IN fuel/NN ./. Wind-powered/JJ pumps/NNS drained/VBD the/DT polders/NNS of/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN arid/JJ regions/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT American/JJ mid-west/NN or/CC the/DT Australian/JJ outback/NN ,/, wind/NN pumps/NNS provided/VBD water/NN for/IN live/JJ stock/NN and/CC steam/NN engines/NNS ./. 
With/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN electric/JJ power/NN ,/, wind/NN power/NN found/VBD new/JJ applications/NNS in/IN lighting/NN buildings/NNS remote/JJ from/IN centrally-generated/JJ power/NN ./.

Today/NN wind/NN powered/VBN generators/NNS operate/VBP in/IN every/DT size/NN range/NN between/IN tiny/JJ plants/NNS for/IN battery/NN charging/VBG at/IN isolated/JJ residences/NNS ,/, up/IN to/TO near-gigawatt/JJ sized/VBN offshore/RB wind/NN farms/NNS that/WDT provide/VBP electricity/NN to/TO national/JJ electrical/JJ networks/NNS ./.
