economic -LRB- Bearbeiten -RRB- The viability of a Windenergienutzung by wind farm depend on the parameter medium wind speed in Nabenhöhe , stromverkaufsprei , installation - and infrastructure cost . 
in most countri today be also economically use inland sit . 
Abhängig of these factor vary the Stromgestehungskosten and , accord to a study publish in may 2012 for the Fraunhofer-Institut Solare energy system between 6 and 8 ct\/kWh ct\/kWh for installation on land . 
the competitivenes of Onshore-Windkraftanlagen compare with conventional pow plant be thu accord to the study of good location already -LRB- state 2012 -RRB- achieve . 
Offshore-Anlagen be against it , owe to high finance operate cost - and despite more Volllaststunden significantly more expensive , their Stromgestehungskosten be currently in 12-16 ct\/kWh . 
-LRB- 7 -RRB- environmentalist argue , wind pow , if all the external cost of energy production -LRB- include the environmental damage cause by pollutant -RRB- , for example , be include alongside the hydroelectric pow , one of the most favourable energy source . 
-LRB- 8 -RRB- howev be in germany , for example , in 2011 by renewabl energi overall ca . 
9.1 billion euro to save external cost . 
-LRB- 9 -RRB- Since the measurement of external cost and benefit , howev , not because of variou methodologi to quantify be clearly come old study with data be not new than 2004 to other result . 
-LRB- 10 -RRB- price of electricity -LRB- Bearbeiten -RRB- The wind pow a a renewable energy contribute to the Merit-Order-Effekt in , and lower at least in the short term by the displacement of conventional pow station electricity price . 
The Merit-Order-Effekt not , howev , take into account the long term change in the composition of the pow station , so that sustainable impact in term of the price of electricity by the say effect can be determine exactly . 
will to windstarken day much from Windenenergie understandable , fed into the wholesale price fall in the electricity exchange . 
there be little wind pow , a rise in the price of electricity exchange . 
The Strompreissenkung by wind pow be cause by the legal Abnahmepflicht for be produce . 
be much electricity from wind pow available , will the use of expensive conventional pow station , especially gas pow -LRB- ` Grenzkosten-Theorie reduce `` -RRB- , lead to a fall in price lead to the electricity exchange . 
-LRB- 11 -RRB- -LRB- 12 -RRB- -LRB- 13 -RRB- -LRB- 14 -RRB- one far reason lie in the Strompreisexplosion . 
on 2 . 
quart of 2008 cost electricity to the leipzig electricity exchange in the fund 8,495 ct\/kWh . 
The Einspeisetarif for wind pow in austria stand at 7.8 ct\/kWh . 
-LRB- 15 -RRB- 2011 , the Anfangsvergütung for wind energy in germany after eec 9.2 ct\/kWh .
