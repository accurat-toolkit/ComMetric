Since ancient times man has harnessed the power of the wind, the earliest known wind mills were vertical axis type, developed by the Persians in 500-900 A.D.[citation needed] One of the most scenic and historic applications of wind power can still be found on the Island of Crete; electric motors of pre-industrial Europe

The first windmills in Europe were developed in 1270 A.D. and were of the horizontal axis type.[citation needed] By 1390 A.D, the Dutch set out to refine the tower mill design and after 500 years of incremental developments the wind sails had all the major features recognized by modern designers. Wind mills were the electric motors of pre-industrial Europe.[citation needed]

Water pumping systems were perfected in 1854, beginning with the Halladay, and continuing with the Dempster Design wind mills.[citation needed] By the end of the 19th Century, the first use of a windmill to generate electricity was a system built in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1888 by Charles F. Brush.[citation needed]

In 1891, Dane Poul La Cour developed the first electrical output wind machine to incorporate aerodynamic design principles.[citation needed] In the century to follow, the integration of composite materials allowed for increased efficiencies and performance.[citation needed] Starting in the early 1990â€™s increasing electricity costs spawned wind farms all over the world.[citation needed]

Wind mills have evolved from being used only for grinding grain and water pumping purposes to a renewable and reliable source of electricity used in various applications such as the following:[citation needed]

    * Water pumping
    * Monitoring sites
    * Cathodic protection
    * Offshore platforms
    * Telecommunications
    * Commercial/retail
    * Sailboats
    * Military
    * Grid-tied electrical systems
    * Remote homes and cabins.
    * Generation of electric energy, see Wind power, Wind turbine
    * Windmill
